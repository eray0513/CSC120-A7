Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

In the cafe class I chose to overload the constructor because I wanted to be able to create a default cafe and a cafe with a name and address but default inventory values and I overloaded the sell coffee method to allow a default cup of coffee to be sold. In the library class I chose to overload the constructor to create a default library and the addTitle method to allow an array list of titles to be added all at once (so groups of books or series can be added fast). In the house class I overloaded the constructor to have a completely default house and to have a house with just a name, address, and number of floors so I could have default elevator and dining room booleans. I also overloaded the moveIn method to allow multiple people to be moved in at once (in the case of whole classes moving in or other instances). What worked was taking breaks, going to office hours, and talking to Vivi and Ruby about our projects. Talking out loud helped me work through it. What didn't work was not thinking critically about why I wanted to overload certain methods. Advice I would give is TALK TO PEOPLE IT WILL DO WONDERS!!!!!
